# Dinosaur-Game
A copy of the dinosaur game, also known as the Chrome Dino, T-Rex Game, Steve the Jumping Dinosaur, or Dino Runner. This game was inspired by the Dinosaur Game that pops up when offline on Google Chrome or by typing chrome://dino or chrome://network-error/-106 in the URL bar. Made proudly by AnaheimDucks16.
